# Legal Contemporary Monologue Sources

## ⚖️ Legal Summary

**Question**: Can we display excerpts/portions of copyrighted contemporary monologues?

**Answer**: **NO** - Not for commercial SaaS use.

Even small excerpts don't qualify for fair use when:
- Your platform is commercial (subscription-based)
- The work is creative in nature (plays/scripts)
- You're using the "heart" of the work (monologues are the essence)
- You compete with the original market (monologue discovery platform)

## ✅ Legal Sources for Contemporary Monologues

### 1. Project Gutenberg (1920s-1960s)

Works published between 1928-1964 that didn't renew copyright are public domain.

**Available Collections:**
- [Contemporary One-Act Plays (1922)](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37970) - B. Roland Lewis et al.
- Fifty Contemporary One-Act Plays (1920) - Frank Shay & Pierre Loving
- One-Act Plays by Modern Authors (1921) - Helen Louise Cohen

**How to find more:**
1. Search Project Gutenberg for plays published 1920-1964
2. Look for theater anthologies from that era
3. Focus on American plays (easier to verify copyright status)

### 2. Creative Commons Licensed Plays

**Sources:**
- [Instant Monologues](https://www.instantmonologues.com/) - Original CC-licensed contemporary monologues
- [Stage Partners](https://www.yourstagepartners.com/resources/free-monologues) - Free contemporary monologues (verify CC license)
- Independent playwrights who explicitly license work under CC

**Verify before scraping:**
- Confirm CC license type (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, etc.)
- Respect attribution requirements
- Check for commercial use restrictions

### 3. Post-1964 Public Domain Works

Works where copyright explicitly lapsed or was dedicated to public domain:
- Some government-funded educational plays
- Works explicitly released to public domain by authors
- Rare, but they exist

## 🚫 What We CANNOT Do

### Illegal Sources:
1. **Modern plays without permission** (post-1978 works are copyrighted for life + 70 years)
2. **"Fair use" excerpts** - Fair use doesn't apply to:
   - Commercial platforms
   - Substantial portions (monologues are substantial)
   - Market substitution (we're a monologue platform)
3. **Scripts from movies/TV** - Almost always copyrighted
4. **Broadway/Off-Broadway plays** - Unless explicitly licensed
5. **Samuel French/Dramatists Play Service** - Copyrighted catalog

### Common Misconceptions:
- ❌ "It's just a portion" - Doesn't matter for commercial use
- ❌ "It's for education" - Our platform is commercial
- ❌ "We're helping promote the work" - Not a legal defense
- ❌ "We link to buy the full script" - Doesn't grant excerpt rights

## 🎯 Recommended Strategy

### Short Term (Now):
1. ✅ Scrape Project Gutenberg contemporary plays (1920s-1960s)
2. ✅ Find CC-licensed original monologues
3. ✅ Identify public domain theater anthologies
4. ✅ Focus on "forgotten" contemporary works from 1920s-1960s

### Medium Term (Q2 2026):
1. Partner with living playwrights for revenue sharing
2. License content from small publishers
3. Create original contemporary monologues
4. User-generated content with proper licensing

### Long Term (Q3-Q4 2026):
1. Licensing deals with major publishers
2. Subscription splits with rights holders
3. Commission original contemporary works
4. Educational partnerships

## 📊 Market Reality

**Coverage Gap:**
- ✅ Classical works (pre-1928): ~5,000+ monologues available
- ⚠️ Early contemporary (1920s-1960s): ~500-1,000 monologues possible
- ❌ Modern contemporary (1970s-2025): Very limited without licensing

**User Demand:**
- Actors need contemporary monologues for modern auditions
- Classical works alone are insufficient for professional actors
- Contemporary content is key competitive differentiator

**Business Decision:**
Build with legal content now, add licensing partnerships as revenue grows.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

See `scrape_contemporary_monologues.py` for automated scraping of legal sources.

**Current automation:**
- Project Gutenberg contemporary play collections
- Automatic monologue extraction
- AI analysis for metadata
- Proper attribution tracking

**To add:**
- More Gutenberg collections (need manual curation)
- CC-licensed play repositories
- Publisher API integrations (future licensing deals)

## 🎭 Bottom Line

**What IS legal:**
- Public domain works (pre-1928, or 1928-1964 without renewal)
- CC-licensed contemporary works with proper attribution
- Works explicitly released to public domain

**What is NOT legal:**
- Any copyrighted work without explicit permission
- "Fair use" excerpts on a commercial platform
- Scraping from unauthorized sources

**When in doubt:**
Assume it's copyrighted. The legal risk isn't worth it for a growing SaaS business.
