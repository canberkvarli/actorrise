/**
 * The actor's line, read as they say it.
 *
 * What this replaces is the reason rehearsal never felt live. The old capture
 * was a batch: open the mic, record a take, notice they stopped, upload the
 * file, wait for a transcript, then decide. Nothing in that sequence knows a
 * word while the actor is still saying it, so the lag was structural and no
 * threshold could tune it away.
 *
 * Seven mechanisms had grown up around that gap, all of them guessing at the
 * one thing the design could not observe — whether the actor had finished.
 * There was a microphone level gate, a minimum quiet, a dropped-tail rule, a
 * trailed-off rule, a finished-and-still rule, a self-heal timeout and a
 * skip-if-silent timer. Seven answers to one question is what it looks like
 * when none of them is the real one, and between them they cut actors off
 * mid-speech, stranded them on noisy rooms, and once moved a scene on for an
 * actor who had said nothing at all.
 *
 * A streaming session answers the question directly. Words arrive as deltas
 * while the actor speaks, so the decision here has two clauses:
 *
 *   1. The last word of the speech has been heard. Go now.
 *   2. The actor has stopped and we heard most of it, or its tail. Go.
 *
 * Clause 1 is the common case and waits on nothing, which is why it feels
 * immediate: an actor who reads to the end of their line hands over on the
 * final syllable, with no silence to sit through at all. Clause 2 is the only
 * safety net, for a line trailed off or misheard. It does not fire on a line
 * the actor is in the middle of: a quiet after "Nay," is a breath, not an
 * ending (prod, Hamlet I.i, the first line of the first real run was taken
 * away 1.4s after its first word). Below the bar, quiet does nothing; the
 * actor keeps going, or swipes to skip.
 *
 * "Stopped" is decided off TRANSCRIPT PROGRESS, not microphone level — see
 * `QUIET_AFTER_WORDS_MS` in hooks/useLiveTranscription.ts. That distinction is
 * the one that matters: the old level gate could sit above its threshold for
 * ever on a phone with AGC or a fan, and when it did, a finished line waited
 * on "Recording…" until the actor gave up. Words arriving is a fact; a volume
 * reading was only ever a proxy for it.
 *
 * Pure, so live-read.test.ts pins it without a microphone or a browser.

 * What used to go wrong is that each delta was read from scratch: the set of
 * heard words was recomputed from nothing, a revision reshaped it, and the
 * highlight flickered between two readings of the same line. Worse, the old
 * greedy matcher would hand a common word to its twin far ahead, so the "last
 * word heard" could be a "you" said in the middle and the line was taken away
 * while the actor was still reading it.
 *
 * So the read now has a position, the next word to say, and `previous` carries
 * it across deltas:
 *
 *   - the position moves only when the alignment supports it: a match at the
 *     next word (or one past it), or a further match that the word after it
 *     agrees with. A single word on its own, a few words ahead, waits until
 *     the actor gets there.
 *   - it never moves back. A revision can change which words the alignment
 *     finds, but it cannot un-read what the actor has read: words behind the
 *     position that were heard stay heard.
 *   - the alignment itself is anchored at the position, with a bounded
 *     look-ahead (see LOOKAHEAD in word-match.ts), so a repeated common word
 *     cannot claim a place twelve words on.
 *
 * Pass the previous read of THE SAME turn. A new turn starts from EMPTY_READ.
