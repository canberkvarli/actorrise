 *     not.
 *
 * Spans in both directions are tried because recognition splits and joins
 * words constantly: "Anita" comes back as "a nita", "twenty four" as
 * "twentyfour". Heard words that match nothing (an ad lib, a filler, a
 * transcriber's guess) are passed over freely.
 *
 * The programme is kept over match ENDS: best[i][j] is the best alignment
 * whose last match finishes at written word i and heard word j. A match
 * starting at (i, j) extends the best of the cells it may follow: any row
 * from i - LOOKAHEAD to i, at any column up to j, read off a running maximum
 * along each row; or, for a far jump, any row at all, read off a running
 * maximum down the rows. That makes it O(line × transcript × LOOKAHEAD) with
