/**
 * The actor's turn transcript, built from the transcriber's items so late

 * earlier turn are retired, and anything for them afterwards is dropped, so
 * the tail of one line (or its tidied-up `completed`) never lands on the next
 * line when two actor lines run back to back. An event with no id is accepted
 * and its item never retired: retiring '' would block every later id-less event.
