THE BREAKUP
A short scene. Author: Sample Script.

JORDAN
We need to talk.

SAM
[sighs] I know.

JORDAN
I've been thinking about us. About where we're going.

SAM
Where do you think we're going?

JORDAN
I don't know anymore. That's the problem. You're never here. When you are, you're on your phone.

SAM
I'm trying to build something. You knew that when we started.

JORDAN
I did. But I didn't know I'd be alone in the same room as you.

SAM
That's not fair.

JORDAN
Isn't it? When was the last time you looked at me? Really looked?

SAM
[quietly] I'm looking now.

JORDAN
It's too late for that.
